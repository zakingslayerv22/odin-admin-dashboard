The Odin Project Admin Dashboard presented the opportunity to practice what was learnt especially in the Grid course. Undertaking this project (which was in the structure of the Holy Grail Layout) has highlighted to me how useful the Grid Layout can be in creating dynamic and responsive layouts. I have also come to the understanding that Grid does not replace Flexbox and they can be used alongside each other.

Completing this project does not make me the Grid specialist as I know that there is still much to learn. I hope to use Grid in more projects in the future and I will be able to strengthen my Grid and CSS skills by then. 

This project marks the end of the Intermediate HTML and CSS course and I am anticipating the next module.
